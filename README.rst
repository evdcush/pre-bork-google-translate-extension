Google Translate ``2.0.13``
###########################
A clone of the `Google Translate browser extension for Chromium <https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb>`_,
before it was borked in ``2.0.15`` (the current/latest version).

This version of the extension, ``2.0.13``, works. üëåüèª

When you click the extension and select ``TRANSLATE THIS PAGE``,
it indeed translates the page, in-place, as it always did before the bork.
